# Crop Recommendation System

This project is a Crop Recommendation System that suggests suitable crops to farmers based on various parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to optimize agricultural productivity by providing precise crop recommendations tailored to the specific environmental conditions.

## Introduction

Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy, and the right crop selection is essential for maximizing yield and profit. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze environmental data and recommend the best crops for cultivation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the `Crop_recommendation.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

- **N**: Amount of nitrogen in the soil
- **P**: Amount of phosphorus in the soil
- **K**: Amount of potassium in the soil
- **temperature**: Temperature in degrees Celsius
- **humidity**: Humidity percentage
- **ph**: pH level of the soil
- **rainfall**: Rainfall in mm
- **label**: Recommended crop

The dataset consists of 2200 samples, with 22 different crops labeled numerically.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Handling of missing values and encoding of categorical data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand relationships between features.
- Model training: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for crop recommendation.
- Visualization: Heatmaps and distribution plots to analyze feature distributions and correlations.

## Installation
